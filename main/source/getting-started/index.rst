===============
Getting Started
===============

Adopting microservices means that your architecture has moved from a
single entity for your business logic to many entities that talk to
each other over the network. The Datawire |mdk| gives you the APIs you
need to code and debug microservices, so that you don't need to worry
about coding basic infrastructure.

The |mdk| is designed to be very lightweight and interoperate with
your existing framework and infrastructure. The MDK supports natively
writing microservices in Ruby, Python, Java, and JavaScript today. It
is also framework agnostic: you can use Rails or Flask or NodeJS, for
example.

Installation
============

To get started with the |mdk|, run the following command on Linux or
Mac OS X:

    curl -# -L
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datawire/mdk/develop/install.sh
    | bash -s
